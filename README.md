# CyberVal - Valorant Proof of Concept Cheat



CyberVal is a proof of concept (POC) cheat for the popular first-person shooter game, Valorant. This project is intended for educational and research purposes only and should not be used in any real-world scenarios or to gain an unfair advantage in the game.

**Disclaimer: Cheating in online games is a violation of the terms of service and can result in severe consequences, including permanent bans. Use this code at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any actions taken against users of this code.**

## Features

- **Aimbot**: CyberVal implements a basic aimbot that automatically aims at the closest enemy within the line of sight. Please note that this aimbot is not optimized for performance and may not be highly accurate.

- **Wallhack**: The cheat provides a rudimentary wallhack that allows players to see the outlines of enemy players through walls. Again, this feature is for demonstration purposes only and may not be as sophisticated as actual cheats.

- **No Recoil**: CyberVal attempts to reduce weapon recoil to improve shooting accuracy. However, it may not be perfect and could result in unexpected behavior.
